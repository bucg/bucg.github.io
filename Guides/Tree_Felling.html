<p>
Seeing as how a lot of our work involves some form of cutting down
trees
it seems like a good idea for us to do it well. This method should be
used
for any tree bigger than about 5cm in diameter.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p> Before doing anything, look at your tree. See where
it is
leaning (i.e. which direction it is likely fall) and check if it is
caught
up anywhere. If any branches are tangled with those of another tree
then unpredictable things can happen. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="fellingplan.gif" alt="Plan before you saw!">
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the tree is reasonably large then mark out the
plan
shown above - in your head if you like, but with sticks on the ground
makes it clearer. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="fellingcuts1.gif" alt="Where you place your cuts is important"> </p>
</li>
<li> The diagram above shows the correct proportions of
the cuts - precise measurements aren't mentioned here because of the
variation in sizes of trees. Also bear in mind that a horizontal cut
means at right angles to the trunk, not necessarily parallel to the
ground!<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Firstly cut your bird's mouth on the side you want
the tree to fall. This involves sawing in horizontally (A) about a
third of
the way through, then down at an angle (B) to remove a 'potato wedge'
shape.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Next make two shallow cuts, one on either side of
the tree (C). This is to prevent the bark from being pulled off if it
splits.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Finally comes the felling cut (D). Before you start
on this warn nearby people and check that the tree is going to fall
safely. Saw in horizontally from behind, above the level of the bird's
mouth.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>As you cut the tree will lean then fall - get ready
to jump out of the way (don't forget where the safe zones are) and
shout a
final warning!
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="fellingend1.gif" alt="This is what it should look like"></p>
</li>
<li> Once the tree has fallen the stump should look like
this.
Finish the job by sawing this off near to the ground, at a slight angle
to allow rain to run off.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note: Trees should be respected, not least because they can cause some
serious damage to people and things when you saw them down. However
also remember that after coppicing, the tree is intended to grow
back so try not to damage anything you aren't cutting off.<br>
