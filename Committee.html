<h1 class="title">BUCG: Committee</h1>
<p>Here are the elected members of the BUCG committee - a
fun
bunch of people who keep the group running with management, hot drinks
and sweets.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Ben Eagle: President</h1>
<p>
<a href="BEagle.2011@my.bristol.ac.uk?Subject=BUCG:">Email.</a><br>
If you&#8217;re new (or old) and can&#8217;t remember who that guy in the flat cap
is, it&#8217;s Ben our President. Having grown up on a farm and with the
hilarious email &#8220;beagle&#8221; it was inevitable he would find his way to
conservation. Ben is multi-talented. Aside from excellent
flatcap-wearing skills he also has time to write several different
blogs, start his own brewery company, intern at the soil association,
and write the history of BUCG. Don&#8217;t worry, we haven&#8217;t got a clue how
he manages to do all that either! </p>
<h1 class="heading">Jamie Wilkinson: Vice President</h1>
<p>Jamie likes trees. This may seem slightly strange when
you consider the amount of time he spends cutting them down.
Nevertheless if you want to know the difference between a pine and a
conifer he will be happy to enlighten you. He also has an affinity with
bivalves and spent a whole summer examining them under a microscope in
the name of SCIENCE!
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Zoë Digby: Treasurer</h1>
<p>Zoë is a not only a dedicated conservationist, but also
an artistic genius having designed last years&#8217; Conservation hoodie
(molly a la marshmallow). Aside from BUCG, she also does Girl Guiding
making her well equipped for bonfire building and marshmallow toasting.
Zoe&#8217;s cheery disposition and super organisational skills mean the
Conservation coffers are in excellent hands.</p>

<h1 class="heading">Kate Louise Howard: Secretary </h1>
<p>Kate&#8217;s conservation credentials are top notch. She spent last summer
volunteering in Borneo with RAG and Moving Mountains, and as a
zoologist loves all creatures great and small. As secretary, Kate is
not only our resident tea and biscuit girl, she also bakes awesome
cakes.
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Jamie Wilkinson: Tools &amp;
Safety
Officer</h1>
<p>Jamie likes trees. This may seem slightly strange when
you consider the
amount of time he spends cutting them down. Nevertheless if you want to
know the difference between an ash and a lime tres he will be happy to
enlighten you. If you also wanted to know the different forces acting
on
the ash/lime as you felled it (which of course you wouldn&#8217;t be
doing as that&#8217;s less conservation and more destruction), as a
Physicist he could tell you all about that too.
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Naomi Lea-Wilson: Tools
&amp;
Safety Officer</h1>
<p>Naomi is known as the enthusiastic one. Whether it&#8217;s arm
waving and offering biscuits to passersby at Freshers, or borrowing the
tools for some extra-curricular lopping, Naomi&#8217;s enthusiasm for
conservation knows no bounds. Naomi is also our resident sustainability
expert having done an internship with the University Sustainability
department. Yes, this committee description is recyclable. </p>
<h1 class="heading">Amy Bowler: Social
Secretary</h1>
<p>Amy was destined to be social secretary from the very
first social she came to. As all good social secretaries do, she
dragged her housemates along showing true social sec spirit from the
start. Amy is another conservationist who embraces her constructive
side, through planting and building sea defences, though of course she
coppices trees with the best of them.
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Lucy Prior: Social Secretary</h1>
<p>Lucy makes very good cakes, scones, biscuits and tea.
This makes her a natural conservationist and social secretary (because
who doesn&#8217;t want cake?). In need of a hole for your sea defence
fencepost? Give her a spade and she will produce one in no time at all.
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Christopher Lock: Webmaster</h1>
<p>A native Bristolian (disappointingly without the accent)
with a fondness for bad puns and an
almost sacrilegious dislike of hot drinks (how can he, in a society
renowned for its tea breaks!). He loves to be out and about in the
countryside, often photographing nature in all its glory. He is also a
bit of a perfectionist;
whether it comes to the website, a photo or a dry stone wall, he will
adjust it
until it's just right. Feel free to <a href="mailto:clock@arck.myzen.co.uk?Subject=BUCG%20Website">email</a>
him any comments, questions and suggestions about the BUCG website.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Molly the Mollusc:
Mascot</h1>
<p>Despite being an inanimate mascot, Molly is a valued
(though much abused) member of BUCG who accompanies us on our trips.<br>
