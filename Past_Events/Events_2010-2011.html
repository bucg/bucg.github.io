<h1 class="title">BUCG: Past Events 2010-2011</h1>
<p> Here is a diary of previous event for the academic year
2010-2011 with recollections by the then president, Becky Pullinger.<br>
<br>
<a href="../Events.html">Back to the main events page</a>
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 15<sup>th</sup>
May 2011: Tickenham Hill (dry stone
walling)
</h1>
<p>The day provided an excellent excuse for procrastinating
about the
upcoming exams and was spent rebuilding a section of dry stone wall at
the Avon Wildlife Trust&#8217;s Reserve. Much of the day was spent digging
out and generally destroying the old wall (which admittedly was in
disrepair). Whilst Jess, Linford and Kate had a lovely day building a
fort the rest of us helped extend the main section of wall.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Saturday 5<sup>th</sup>
- Sunday 6<sup>th</sup>
March 2011: Devon Weekend
</h1>
<p>A relatively warm weekend (glossing over the cold night
spent in a Yurt) led to the clearance of a section of the Tarka Trail,
providing light to walkers and plants alike. The trailer bike
used to transport chopped wood provided some hilarity.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 27<sup>th</sup>
February 2011: Cadbury Camp (scrub
bashing)
</h1>
<p>That tree didn&#8217;t stand a chance. Victoria and Linford
took a tree down with the double handled bow saw, whilst the rest of us
chopped, lopped, sawed and pulled down the brambles a hawthorn of the
slope.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 20<sup>th</sup>
February 2011: Lower Woods
(coppicing)
</h1>
<p>Coppicing and scrub clearance were once again the name
of the day. Naomi felled a tree on&nbsp;Lucy, showing a vital
glimpse of the skills needed to become tools and safety officer. Posts
were successfully dug in to mark the boundary of where we had worked,
and two stumps were chiselled into a lovely snail and BUCG identifier.
A walk around the reserve gave a good opportunity to see other areas
done by BUCG over the years.
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 6<sup>th</sup>
February 2011: Sandpool (tree
planting)
</h1>
<p>This trip may help to make BUCG carbon neutral! A day
was spent planting many trees to increase suitable habitat for bats. As
this was part of a wider Wildlife Trust event, we also took part in a
duck fishing game and some face painting. The new muscle work out was
enjoyed by all.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 23<sup>rd</sup>
January 2011: Berrow Dunes (scrub
clearance)
</h1>
<p>A sunny day was spent cutting scrub and instead of
burning it, we made a retaining structure to prevent blowouts occurring
in the sand dunes. The Somerset Coastal Change project filmed some of
the day, with Steve obligingly doing many takes of delicately placing a
branch into the hedge. You can see us and learn about the work we did on the <a href="http://www.somersetcoastalchange.org.uk/galleries/somerset_coast_dune_gallery" target="_blank">Somerset Coastal Change website</a>. We even got a mention on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-14764148">BBC
news website</a>.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 28<sup>th</sup>
November 2010:
Lower Woods
</h1>
<p>CANCELLED. Snowy and icy conditions led to the event
being called off.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Saturday 20<sup>th</sup>
- Sunday 21<sup>st</sup>
November 2010: Alfrick Weekend
</h1>
<p>The autumn weekend trip was back in Alfrick to help
Trevor and Annette at the Ravenshill Woodland reserve with kind support
from the Alumni Foundation. After oohing and aahing at the newly
renovated village hall, we arrived and started work.
We began by carting some rather large logs around the reserve to make a
permanent outdoor structure. We also carried out some coppicing, being
careful to leave some branches over the paths for dormice.
The evening required a trip to the local pub and a game of Cranium.
Much fun was had by all, with particular highlights including Steve&#8217;s
acting
out of &#8216;Happy Hour&#8217;, Steve&#8217;s Irish dancing (I think) and Aerobics.
At the end of the event it was noted that Trevor didn&#8217;t tell his
thumb/tiredness story&#8230; so those who had heard it a few times before
related it to those who hadn&#8217;t. The minibus trip was home rather quiet
as we all, except Steve, napped.
</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 7<sup>th</sup>
November 2010: Weston Big Wood (scrub
clearance)
</h1>
<p>The group carried out scrub clearance in the Avon
Wildlife Trust reserve. We removed dense bramble and drank tea.
However, the group did lose a pitchfork and a pair of loppers, leading
to Steve revolutionising the system for tools (there is now one).</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 31<sup>st</sup>
October 2010: Leigh Woods (coppicing)</h1>
<p>A small but motley crew went over the suspension bridge
to the National Trust reserve to take part in some organised
destruction.
Clare&#8217;s face lit up as her eyes pinpointed a small patch of trees that
required chopping down.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 24<sup>th</sup>
October 2010: Lawrence Weston Moor (reed cutting)
</h1>
<p>Another trip was back to this Avon Wildlife Trust
reserve with slashers and scythes to help with the annual reed cut.
Once we had been given the safety talk, we made sure we stood far
enough apart so that no-one's legs were removed. A quick reassurance
was required for
the fire brigade who had come to investigate the source of all the
smoke.</p>
<h1 class="heading">Sunday 10<sup>th</sup>
October 2010: St Werburghs City
Farm, Boiling Wells
</h1>
<p>A sunny day greeted the first event of the year. After
getting everyone to introduce themselves, with an aid of an animal, the
group helped the city farm prepare for its annual apple day. Paths were
made child friendly, wood chip was laid across the paths, nettles were
removed and drop scones eaten.</p>
<h1 class="heading">September 2010: Arran Week,
Scotland</h1>
<p>The week long summer trip was back in Arran this year to
help on the National Trust for Scotland reserve at Goat Fell. Tasks
included rhodie bashing, bridge fixing, bog drainage, making fences
clearer and playing in the playground. It wasn&#8217;t all work though: we
had a few
treks to the pub (including on my birthday) and we played various card
games and&nbsp;Robo Rally. Before leaving the island
we had two days off, and two lovely walks (not everyone did both walks
&#8211; you could have lazy days if wished) before we embarked on the long
trek
back to Bristol (or wherever we were going).</p>
