<h1 class="title">BUCG: Health and Safety</h1>
<p>Here you can find important information on avoiding
accidents and injuries (to yourself or others). We use a number of
potentially dangerous tools on our conservation trips so an&nbsp;
awareness of
how to use them safely and what to do in the case of an accident is of
great importance. However, don't let this put you off as no prior
knowledge or experience is required; safety talks will be given by our
Tools and Safety officers at the start of each trip.<br>
<br>
If you are very saftey conscious then why not take a look at our risk
assessment form (left click <a href="Documents/Risk_Assessment_Form_2011.doc" target="_blank">this link</a> and select "Save as..." to
download).</p>
<h1 class="heading">General Tool Safety Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Place tools flat on the floor where they can be
clearly seen and so that they pose little danger if you fall on it
accidentally. With a pitchfork, make sure the prongs are facing down
into the ground.</li>
<br>
<li>When carrying tools hold them down by your side. Be
careful when walking down slopes or on slippery surfaces. When you slip
your arm may flail outwards.</li>
<br>
<li>All tools with a blue and white tag belong to
the society. There should be no confusion as long as any other groups
don't use the same colouring system.</li>
<br>
<li>Sometimes tools (such as slashers and billhooks) need
sharpening. Use the sharpening stones found in the yellow bag. Make a
circular motion along the edge of the blade.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading">Bowsaws</h1>
<ul>
<li>Wear gloves to protect fingers. Start by slowly
marking a groove into the wood, then saw hard!</li>
<br>
<li>Use them to cut trees/branches bigger than your
ungloved thumb. Loppers and billhooks should be used to cut things
which are smaller.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading">Loppers</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use them to cut branches that are smaller than the
size of your ungloved thumb.</li>
<br>
<li>Wear gloves whilst using them. Loppers are not
swinging
tools and are made of plastic/metal. Gloves will also protect your
hands from brambles.</li>
<br>
<li>When not using them you should PLACE them on the
ground. NO THROWING, as it can give the nuts and bolts holding the
cutting mechanism in place a jolt and loosen them, making them less
effective.</li>
<br>
<li>Hold them by your sides with the blades closed whilst
walking. Don't fling your hands out if you lose your balance. </li>
<br>
<li>If the loppers get stuck or fail to cut through the
branch just pull open the blades and have another go. Don't wiggle the
loppers around with the blades closed on the branch as this will damage
them and loosen the bolts.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading">Billhooks</h1>
<ul>
<li>The curved edge of a billhook is used for stripping
branches from large tree trunks. The trunk can then be used as a
stake for making hedges. The flat edge can be used to sharpen stakes so
that they may be hammered into the ground. </li>
<br>
<li>Gloves should NOT be worn. The handle is made of wood
and a billhook is a swinging tool. Using gloves will diminish your grip
on the billhook. This could be dangerous.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading">Slashers</h1>
<ul>
<li>Slashers are used for clearing large areas of plants
such as brambles and vinelike vegetation close to the ground.</li>
<br>
<li>Gloves are NOT WORN. The handle is made of wood and a
slasher is a swinging tool. Using gloves will diminish your grip on the
slasher. This could be dangerous.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading">Pitchforks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use pitchforks for placing branches on the fire. They
can be used to scrape together the scraps of wood left after trees have
been chopped down as well.</li>
<br>
<li>As a pitchfork isn't a swinging tool gloves are
optional.</li>
<br>
<li>Keep your hand on the end of the fork so that you
know where it is and can avoid whacking people in the face.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading">Spades</h1>
<ul>
<li>Cut into the ground by pushing down on the blade with
your boot. Try using the thick part of the sole of your boot such as
the toes or the heel. The mid-section is generally thin and the spade
may cut through your boots.</li>
<br>
<li>Hold onto the ends of them just like with pitchforks.</li>
<br>
<li>Gloves are recommended.</li>
</ul>
